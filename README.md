- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @a-random-lemurian

# TL:DR
All I do is make endless ATC custom airport files, and maybe a mindustry/other game mod here and there..
# Who am I?
I'm [REDACTED], also known as a-random-lemurian, from the Philippines, and actively eats large amounts of ramen, burgers, cheeseburgers, any kind of food.

As for my Endless ATC endeavours, we've been sending planes to find ~~Zac's secret copy of the London TMA that he's been hoarding since the start of the aviation industry~~.
